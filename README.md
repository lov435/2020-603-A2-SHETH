This repository contains a C++ application that experiments the run time of a KNN algorithm on four different datasets (mini, small, medium and large). It implements three methods: (1) non CUDA (2) basic CUDA (3) advance CUDA. 

In order to run this program, one must specify three command line parameters (1) dataset file path (2) k value - should be odd (3) method. The large arg method can be m1, m2 or m3 that correspond to non-CUDA, basic CUDA and advance CUDA methods.
